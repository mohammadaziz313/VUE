Directives:
a) v-bind: Binds HTML elements to the Vue Instance.
b) v-once: renders the contents once only.
c) v-html: It tells VueJS to render the text provided as a html tag instead of text

Event Modifiers:
a) v-on:mousemove.stop : This will stop the propagation of the events.

Two-way data binding:
v-model: We use this directive for two way data binding.

Using Computed properties:
Computed properties are important since it doesn't re-render the contents if the property dependent on
on the function doesn't change. We should always use this instead of methods.

Using watch property:
We use this in case of asynchronous tasks. These are always applied on data properties. It is a good practice
to always use Computed properties.

v-on -> @
v-bind -> :
